# Look-Up-Android
Built an Android Application, which takes an image as an input and will suggest the user with the probable objects detected in the image. The detected objects can then be used by the user to either run an online search or the application can suggest the possible stores in which the user can find the product. Implemented using Google Vision API and Places near me API.
